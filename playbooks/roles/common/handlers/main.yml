# Note: Handlers are grouped here to be ordered properly, see
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/glossary.html#notify

# These handlers are used from other roles and thus the path needs to be
# specified to go back to the roles dir (from the role calling handler)
# Doing inter-role includes is a bit wonky.
